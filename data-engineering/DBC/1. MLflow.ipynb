It is organized around the concept of **runs**, which are executions of data science code.  Runs are aggregated into **experiments** where many runs can be a part of a given experiment and an MLflow server can host many experiments.\n\n\nMLflow tracking also serves as a **model registry** so tracked models can easily be stored and, as necessary, deployed into production. This also standardizes this process, which significantly accelerates it and allows for scalability. Experiments can be tracked using libraries in Python, R, and Java as well as by using the CLI and REST calls.  This module will use Python, though the majority of MLflow functionality is also exposed in these other APIs."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"ade0b6e0-2ce9-44e2-9276-105bcf5881e7"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Track Runs\n\nEach run can record the following information:<br><br>\n\n- **Parameters:** Key-value pairs of input parameters such as the number of trees in a random forest model\n- **Metrics:** Evaluation metrics such as RMSE or Area Under the ROC Curve\n- **Artifacts:** Arbitrary output files in any format.
